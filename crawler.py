# A runtime independant from main.py, intended to be ran 24/7, performing searches and crawls, then embedding them.
# Our focus will be on balancing link-crawling, and novel article parsing (news extraction),
# as well as wikipedia info crawls.
# All our data will be stored in it's raw form as well, to make it simple to transfer it to another embedding format.

# TODO: any moment, user should be able to add new search queries, and perhaps change link/research balance.
#   example input: ADD news "openai lawsuit"
